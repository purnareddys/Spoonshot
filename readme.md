### Tech (MERN)

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development
- [node.js](nodejs.org)- evented I/O for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) - NoSQL database

### Installation

For starting backend server

```sh
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ nodemon server.js
```

For frontend

```sh
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Functionality

- Add a new book to Inventory(database)
- Display all the existing books in inventory
- Delete a specific book in inventory
- Update the count of existing book in inventory.

### Thought Process

- I have Implemented a web app using MERN Stack, because I have good experince in working with it. But I am very keen on learning python,
- I Choose React because it one of the best SPA library, and also I have been working with react from about 1 year. (This application contains only hooks)
